# StairWays

This repository contains an exploration of the problem of calculating the number of ways it is possible to climb stairs given a constrained set of allowable step increments. 

Given an array of positive integers representing the number of steps that can be taken at a time (named I), for example 1 or 2 steps each move. And a positive integer representing the total number of steps (named T). Calculate the total number of ways it is possible to move from the bottom of the stairs (step 0) to the top of the stairs (step T), taking any combination of step increments defined by I.
